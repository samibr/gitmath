Let $A,B\in \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$. Suppose that the matrix $A$ is nilpotent and that the matrix $B$ commutes with $A$. What can be said about $\operatorname{Tr}(AB)$?

{{<hint>}}
The matrix $AB$ is also nilpotent. Why? And remember (or prove) that $0$ is the only eigenvalue for a nilpotent matrix.
