Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $n\ge 2$. Is the endomorphism $\varphi$ of $\mathbb{C}_n[X]$, which maps the polynomial $P(X)$ to the polynomial $P(X+1)-P(X)$, diagonalizable?

{{<hint>}}
One may write the matrix of $\varphi $ with respect to a well-chosen basis or reason by contradiction and use the fundemental theorem of algebra.
